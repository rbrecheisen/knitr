Parse folders and files in /templates and display these entries in an index html. At
a later stage we can make something pretty out of this. For example I could add a 
simple admin page that allows me to upload a new HTML file (generated with Knitr) and
specify a nice title + description for it.

TODO

- Dockerize the app
- Admin page
  - Upload new Knitr HTML docs (provide name+desc)
- Deploy to DataHub
